/*
 * Description:
 * 		Establishes a MQTT connection to Medium One using the provided credentials. If device::user_id
 * 		has a non-zero length, device credentials are used when attempting to connect to the Medium One
 * 		MQTT broker. If the credentials are rejected, and registration credentials are provided, the
 * 		connection will be re-attempted with registration credentials. If the connection is successful
 * 		with registration credentials, enrollment will be initiated to obtain credentials for this device.
 * 		Enrollment is dependent on the device having a unique_id provided by FMI. If successful, the new
 * 		credentials will be returned in device.
 *
 * 		A dedicated M1 agent thread is created, if it does not already exist. During m1_auto_enroll_connect(),
 * 		if connection is successful, the following data is transmitted to
 * 		the Medium One "raw" datastream:
 * 			“connected”: true
 * 			"ip_address": <WAN_IP>
 * 			"unique_id": <Unique ID> (from FMI)
 * 			"product_name": <Product Name> (from FMI)
 * 			"product_market": <Product Marking> (from FMI)
 * 			"mask_revision": <Mask Revision> (from FMI)
 * 			"quality_code": <Quality Code> (from FMI)
 * 			"ssp_version": <SSP Version> (ssp_version_t) (from FMI)
 * 			"mac_address": <mac address> (if available) (from NetX)
 * 			"lan_address": <lan_address> (if available) (from NetX)
 * 		Finally a subscription is made to the Medium One subscription topics for the specified user.
 * 		The dedicated agent thread maintains and monitors the MQTT connection. If the connection drops,
 * 		the agent will continuously try to reconnect, with a delay of 5 seconds between attempts.
 * 		This is a blocking call.
 * Parameters:
 * 		mqtt_url: 		MQTT broker
 * 		mqtt_port: 		MQTT port
 * 		project:		MQTT project ID (provided by docs) and project API key
 * 		registration: 	optional MQTT user ID and password for API registration user
 * 		device: 		MQTT user ID and password for API basic user
 * 		device_id:		device identifier, maximum 60 characters
 * 		retry_limit: 	The number of times to retry (recommend 5 times)
 * 		retry_delay: 	The time delay (seconds) between retry (recommend 5 seconds)
 * 		mqtt_heart_beat:period (seconds) between MQTT ping (recommended 300 seconds)
 * 		tls_enabled: 	1 to use TLS
 *		ssl_mem:		optional pointer to start of contiguous memory block to be used by SSL.
 *						should be ~30k for successful TLS connections. if not specified, memory is allocated from heap
 *		ssl_mem_size:	optional size of contiguous memory block pointed to by ssl_mem
 *		p_ppool:		pointer to NX_PACKET_POOL instance to use
 *		p_ip:			pointer to NX_IP instance to use
 *		p_dns:			pointer to NX_DNS instance to use
 * Errors:
 * 		M1_ERROR_INVALID_URL -			must end with "mediumone.com"
 * 		M1_ERROR_UNABLE_TO_CONNECT - 	returned if a fatal error occurs. fatal errors include:
 *									 		- Network unavailable
 *                                          - Incorrect MQTT broker URL or port
 *                                          - Using TLS with non-TLS port, or vice-versa
 *		M1_ERROR_ALREADY_CONNECTED -	returned if already connected
 *		M1_ERROR_BAD_CREDENTIALS - 		returned if
 *		                                    - device is NULL
 *                                          - device credentials are incorrect and registration is NULL
 *                                          - device credentials are incorrect and registration credentials are incorrect
